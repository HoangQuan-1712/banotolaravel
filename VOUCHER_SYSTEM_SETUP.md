# 🎁 Car Dealership Voucher System Setup Guide

## Overview
This voucher system implements three powerful strategies for your car dealership:

1. **🎯 Tiered Choice** - Upsell customers to higher-value cars
2. **🎲 Random Gift** - Create marketing buzz and excitement  
3. **👑 VIP Tier** - Build long-term customer loyalty

## Quick Setup

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Seed Sample Data
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=VoucherSeeder
```

### 3. Update User Model
Make sure your User model has the tier relationship:
```php
// In app/Models/User.php
public function tier() { 
    return $this->belongsTo(CustomerTier::class, 'tier_id'); 
}
```

## 🎯 Tiered Choice System

**Purpose**: Encourage customers to buy more expensive cars to unlock better rewards.

### How it works:
- **$50K - $100K orders**: Choose from window tinting, dash cam, or 1-year maintenance

### Business Impact:
- Increases average order value
- Customers upgrade their purchase to access better rewards
- Clear incentive structure drives upselling

### Example Usage:
```php
$voucherService = new VoucherService();
$tieredChoices = $voucherService->getTieredChoices($order, $user);
// Returns vouchers grouped by tier level
```

## 🎲 Random Gift System

**Purpose**: Create excitement and marketing buzz around purchases.

### How it works:
- Every completed purchase gets a random gift

  - 40% chance: Premium Accessories Kit ($500)
  - 25% chance: Free Maintenance Package ($1,200)
  - 20% chance: Professional Detailing ($800)

if ($randomGift) {
    $voucherService->applyVoucher($randomGift, $order, $user);
}
```

$tierUpgrade = $tierService->checkTierUpgrade($user, $order);
if ($tierUpgrade['upgraded']) {
    // Show congratulations message
    // Unlock new VIP vouchers

```
